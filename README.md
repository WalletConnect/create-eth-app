## Create an App

To use `create-eth-app`, you will need Node & Yarn installed on your local development machine.

To create a new app, run the following command:

`yarn create eth-app my-app`

This command will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder. Inside that directory, it will generate the following project structure and install the necessary dependencies.

(Project structure)

Once the installation is complete, you can `cd` into `my-app` and run some built-in commands:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode on http://localhost:3000 in the browser.
